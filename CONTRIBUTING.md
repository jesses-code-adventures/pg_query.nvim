## Scope

This repo is designed to interact with [pg_query_utils](https://github.com/timwmillard/pg_query_utils.git), and as such support for databases outside of postgres is currently out of scope.

The problem we're aiming to solve is that of context switching between Neovim and your database query editor, so the feedback loop between editing queries and running them can be much faster. As such, adding support for `output-mode`s aside from `pbcopy` and `psql-tmux` would be considered in scope, provided the new mode is a reasonably common way to interact with databases.

## Todo

- [x] Edit command - edit the values associated with a query.
- [x] Run command - get the query with the values inserted, and output to the `output-mode`. If there are no values to insert, open up the `edit` window.
- [x] Output mode - formatted query to clipboard with `pbcopy`.
- [x] Output mode - formatted query to psql, in a new tmux window.
- [ ] Handle using the query `name` from the comment for the internal `query` field, instead of using the fingerprint. Waiting on this to be implemented in `pg_query_prepare --details`.
- [ ] Config setting to error on missing db creds vs silently fail.
- [ ] Ability to have variants for query arguments, which would be stored in their own temp files.
- [ ] Handle matching up the stored values when a query's order of args, or number of args, has changed.
- [ ] Abstract `OUTPUT_MODE`s so that they're relatively easy for anyone to add, ideally as config.
- [ ] Ability to override environment variable labels for DB creds for a project (maybe some kind of config file, or we could store some metadata in the `.git` directory more quietly).

- In the repo, run `make init`.

### Dev Lazy Config
